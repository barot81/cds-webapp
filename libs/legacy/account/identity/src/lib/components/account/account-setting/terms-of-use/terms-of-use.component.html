  <p>
    zhealthcare is a platform that enables health professional schools (each, a

    clinical sites (each, a “Clinic”, and each individual who is Student, a
    representative of a School or a representative of a Clinic is referred to as
    a “User” and, collectively, as “Users”). Users may have accounts and access
    the system to facilitate placement of Students in internships with Clinics.
    <br />
    4.1. Account. To access the Service, a User must have an account. You can
    create an account by completing the registration process. You may be
    required to provide information about yourself or, if applicable, your
    employer or organization as part of the registration process or your

    that you submit to zhealthcare will be correct, accurate and up to date. <br />

    password or of your account. <br />
    4.4. Account Sharing or Transfers. Accounts are registered to you personally
    and may not be sold or otherwise transferred at any time under any
    circumstances. Unless you are using your account on behalf of an
    organization and have the right to share your account with other employees
    of your organization (in which case, you may only share your account with
    such other permitted employees), you may not share your account and you may
    not disclose your password to anyone else. <br />

    your account at any time by making a request to your School. zhealthcare will
    cancel your account promptly following receipt of your cancellation request
    from your School. Once you cancel your account, any personal information

    previously shared with Schools and/or Clinics may remain viewable by those
    Users until they delete such content. <br />
    4.6. Termination by zhealthcare. zhealthcare may at any time terminate your account if:
    <br />
    a. zhealthcare determines that you are (a) in breach of or otherwise acting
    inconsistently with these ToU or (b) engaging in fraudulent or illegal
    activities or other conduct that may result in liability to zhealthcare; <br />
    b. zhealthcare determines it is required by law to terminate your account; <br />
    c. zhealthcare decides to stop providing the Service or critical portions of the
    Service in the country where you reside, discontinues access to the Site or

    Service; or <br />

    Student’s account. <br />
    4.7. Effect of Account Termination or Cancellation. If you voluntarily

    reactivate that account at any time by contacting zhealthcare, or, if you are a
    Student, by making a request to your School to reactivate your account and
    zhealthcare will reactivate your account promptly following receipt of your
    reactivation request from your School. Accounts terminated by zhealthcare for any

  </p>
  <br />

  </p>
  <br />
  <u>16. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. </u>
  <p>
    These ToU are governed by California law, without regard to conflict of laws
    principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and zhealthcare
    agree that, except as otherwise provided in Section 17 below, the state and
    federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles, California will have
    exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes arising out of or related to these

    injunctions) in any jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <br />
  <u>17. Binding Arbitration.</u>
  <p>
    <br />
    17.1. Arbitration Procedures. You and zhealthcare agree that, except as provided
    in Section 17.4 below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to
    these ToU (each a “Claim”), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by
    binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a
    written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to
    arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The
    arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
    Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is
    initiated (the “JAMS Rules”) and under the terms set forth in these ToU. In
    the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 17 and
    the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 17 will control and prevail.
    Except as otherwise set forth in Section 17.4, you may seek any remedies
    available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration
    action. As part of the arbitration, both you and zhealthcare will have the
    opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to
    the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the
    arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the
    arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is
    based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall
    be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather
    than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these ToU, (a) you and
    zhealthcare may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
    arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award
    entered by the arbitrator; and (b) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final,
    binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction,
    provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow
    applicable law. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND
    THAT YOU AND zhealthcare WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
    <br />
    17.2. Location. Any arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, California,
    unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection
    appearances. <br />
    17.3. Limitations. You and zhealthcare agree that any arbitration shall be limited
    to the Claim between zhealthcare and you individually. YOU AND zhealthcare AGREE THAT
    (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A
    CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (b) THERE IS NO
    RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED
    REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (c) NO
    ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION. <br />
    17.4. Exceptions to Arbitration. You and zhealthcare agree that the following
    Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and
    binding arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or
    concerning the validity of, any of zhealthcare’s intellectual property rights; (b)
    any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
    invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable
    relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual
    action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such
    court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. <br />
    17.5. Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will
    need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating
    arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS for
    initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will
    be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules. <br />
    17.6. Severability. You and zhealthcare agree that if any portion this Section 17
    is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 17.4), that
    portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given
    full force and effect. If Section 17.4 is found to be illegal or
    unenforceable then neither you nor zhealthcare will elect to arbitrate any Claim
    falling within that portion of Section 17.4 found to be illegal or
    unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of
    competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, United
    States of America, and you and zhealthcare agree to submit to the personal
    jurisdiction of that court.
