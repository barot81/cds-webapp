          <h3 class="pb-12">What is web accessibility?</h3>
          <p class="pb-12">
            When sites are designed, developed and edited correctly, all users
            would have equal access to information and functionality. However,
            currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility
            barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to
            use. The web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, no
            matter what their hardware, software, language, culture, location of
            physical or ability.
          </p>

          <h3 class="pb-12">Why test for accessibility?</h3>
          <p class="pb-12">
            It is essential to test all applications for accessibility to
            improve the customer experience. Developers and organizations are
            increasingly making sure to create high-quality websites and web
            tools, and not exclude people from using their products and
            services.
          </p>
          <h3>Importance of accessibility:</h3>
          <ul class="pb-12">
            <li>Improves maintainability and efficiency</li>
            <li>Increase market share and audience reach</li>
            <li>Aids usability</li>
            <li>
              Easy and efficient access to users with impairment and challenges
            </li>
            <li>Assists in access for low-bandwidth users</li>
            <li>Better and more maintainable code</li>
            <li>Good SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</li>
            <li>Maintains customer loyalty and brand value</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="pb-12">1) Testing using keyboard navigation</h4>
          <p class="pb-12">
            The first step in manual testing is to throw away your mouse. Verify
            that the user is able to navigate the website page, including the
            header, footer, all menus and interactive elements using only the
            keyboard.

          <p>
            Validating keyboard accessibility: It is an important step to
            evaluate accessible interactions by using a keyboard.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-12">
            Below is the complete checklist which one can follow on a variety of
            desktop/mobile devices while using external keyboards.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Keyboard focus:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure that the focus order on the site follows the visual order
              of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that all functionality is easy to use and available using
              only the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that whenever a user changes focus on the web page, there
              is no change of context.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that keyboard focus is always visible and easy to
              recognize.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Tab order:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>TAB through the page to see if the order is logical.</li>
            <li>
              See if you can activate all interactive elements with Enter and
              Space keys.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tab order should be logical. It should be left to right and
                  top to bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All elements on the page can be reached by keyboard. This
                  includes drop downs, menu items, buttons and other interactive
                  elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users can select the menu items or drop down items with the
                  keyboard.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Forms:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tab order of forms should be logical.</li>
            <li>
              If there is a drop down menu, users should be able to navigate and
              select items using keyboard alone.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Dialog box and pop-ups:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As soon as the dialog opens up, keyboard focus should be set on
              the dialog.
            </li>
            <li>Dialog can be dismissed using keyboard.</li>
            <li>
              When the dialog is closed, focus should be set on the element
              which activated the dialog on the parent page.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="pb-12">2) Testing using a screen reader</h4>

          <p>Here’s the QA checklist for testing using a screen reader:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure that the page has a relevant page title. so that screen
              reader users know what page they are on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that images which are not decorative are read by the screen
              reader, and that they have relevant alt text.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure decorative images are not read by the screen reader.</li>
            <li>
              Ensure all the interactive elements (buttons, checkbox, links,
              radio button, edit box) are rendering the role. Example: button or
              link.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that all interactive elements (buttons, checkboxes, links,
              radio buttons, edit boxes) have labels. Example: "Submit" for a
              Submit button/link.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure error fields have relevant error message.</li>
            <li>
              Ensure error messages are announced by the screen reader as soon
              as they appear on the page.
            </li>
