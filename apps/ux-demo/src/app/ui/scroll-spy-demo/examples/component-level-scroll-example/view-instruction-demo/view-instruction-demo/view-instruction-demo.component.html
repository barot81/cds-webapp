     <p tabindex="0">The purpose of developing this tool was in response to academic and clinical educators’ requests to 
       provide a voluntary, consistent and uniform approach for students to evaluate clinical education as 
       well as the overall clinical experience. Questions included in this draft tool were derived from the 
       many existing tools already in use by physical therapy programs for students to evaluate the quality 
       of the clinical learning experience and clinical instructors (CIs), as well as academic preparation 
       for the specific learning experience. The development of this tool was based on key assumptions for 
       the purpose, need for, and intent of this tool. These key assumptions are described in detail below.
        This tool consists of two sections that can be used together or separately: Section 1-Physical 
        therapist student assessment of the clinical experience and Section 2-Physical therapist student
        assessment of clinical instruction. Central to the development of this tool was an assumption
        that students should actively engage in their learning experiences by providing candid
        feedback, both formative and summative, about the learning experience and with summative
        feedback offered at both midterm and final evaluations. One of the benefits of completing
        Section 2 at midterm is to provide the CI and the student with an opportunity to modify
        the learning experience by making midcourse corrections.

        <li tabindex="0">The tool is intended to provide the student’s assessment of the quality of the clinical learning experience and the quality of clinical instruction for the specific learning experience.</li>
        <li tabindex="0">The tool allows students to objectively comment on the quality and richness of the learning experience and to provide information that would be helpful to other students, adequacy of their preparation for the specific learning experience, and effectiveness of the clinical educator(s).</li>
        <li tabindex="0">The tool is formatted in Section 2 to allow student feedback to be provided to the CI(s) at both midterm and final evaluations. This will encourage students to share their learning needs and expectations during the clinical experience, thereby allowing for program modification on the part of the CI and the student.</li>
        <li tabindex="0">Sections 1 and 2 are to be returned to the academic program for review at the conclusion of the clinical experience. Section 1 may be made available to future students to acquaint them with the learning experiences at the clinical facility. Section 2 will remain confidential and the academic program will not share this information with other students.</li>
        <li tabindex="0">The tools meet the needs of the physical therapist (PT) and physical therapist assistant (PTA) academic and clinical communities and where appropriate, distinctions are made in the tools to reflect differences in PT scope of practice and PTA scope of work.</li>
        <li tabindex="0">The student evaluation tool should not serve as the sole entity for making judgments about the quality of the clinical learning experience. This tool should be considered as part of a systematic collection of data that might include reflective student journals, self-assessments provided by clinical education sites, Center Coordinators of Clinical Education (CCCEs), and CIs based on the Guidelines for Clinical Education, ongoing communications and site visits, student performance evaluations, student planning worksheets, Clinical Site Information Form (CSIF), program outcomes, and other sources of information.</li>

     <p tabindex="0">We would like to acknowledge the collaborative effort between the Clinical Education Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Education Section and APTA’s Education Department in completing this project. We are especially indebted to those individuals from the Clinical Education SIG who willingly volunteered their time to develop and refine these tools. Comments and feedback provided by academic and clinical faculty, clinical educators, and students on several draft versions of this document were instrumental in developing, shaping, and refining the tools. Our gratitude goes out to all of those individuals and groups who willingly gave their time and expertise to work toward a common voluntary PT and PTA Student Evaluation Tool of the Clinical Experience and Clinical Instruction.
